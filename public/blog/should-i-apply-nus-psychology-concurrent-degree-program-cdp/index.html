<p>Every year, the department of Psychology sends out little postcards to the second-year undergraduates inviting them to apply for the <strong>Concurrent Degree Program (CDP)</strong>. More often than not, these postcards are met with confusion over what this program actually is. The <a href="https://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/psy/prospective/index.html#concurrent">department website</a> does give a good introduction to what the program offers. This review aims to complement the website, providing a more student-centric explanation/reflection about the program and the frequently asked questions (from juniors) that are not found on the website.</p>
<p>Firstly, an introduction to the CDP in NUS Psychology. In essence, it condenses the <strong>Bachelor of Social Sciences (Hons)</strong> and <strong>Master of Social Science (Psychology by Research)</strong> into one package. Doing the two degrees separately would require <em>6</em> years, <em>4</em> for Bachelor program and <em>2</em> for the Masters program. In contrast, the CDP only takes <em>5</em> years. Some questions that are frequently asked:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How does it condense the two programs?
<ul>
<li>Mainly by increasing the workload for the last <em>2</em> years. In the last two years, we had to take on the workload of a Masters student + the coursework requirement of the Bachelor (Hons) program. Luckily we only need to do one thesis for both programs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sounds great but are there any drawbacks to this program?
<ul>
<li>Other than the increased workload, here are some of the drawbacks that I am aware of.
<ul>
<li>Tuition fees for the last two years are charged according to the Masters program, which is slightly more expensive than the Bachelor program.</li>
<li>Additional year of study is an additional year of fees.</li>
<li>Opportunity cost, one more year of studying is one less year of working.</li>
<li>Ample preparation is needed to apply for the program.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Should I apply for the CDP?
<ul>
<li>Consider a few things: Do you have a career plan?
<ul>
<li>If your plan requires a Masters –&gt; Does it require a research-based degree?
<ul>
<li>This is important because the Masters degree from the CDP is a <strong>research</strong> degree. And from my own experience talking to seniors and HR, this is not a perfect replacement for specialized degrees such as Clinical or I/O Psychology degrees.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If your plan does not require a Masters, but it requires a Phd instead.
<ul>
<li>If you are confident that you can enroll directly into a Phd program after your Bachelors, I would say just skip the Masters and the CDP.</li>
<li>On the other hand, having a Masters (in Research) would benefit your Phd application. So it can increase your odds of getting into the more prestigious programs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If your plan does not require a Masters or a Phd.
<ul>
<li>Then nope.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>But should I get a Masters even if my plan does not require it? I may need it in the future.
<ul>
<li>This is a tough one. I would say no, as it is possible that your company may sponsor your Masters degree if your job really requires it. And it is also possible they would require a more specialized degree.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
