      <description>Every year, the department of Psychology in NUS sends out little postcards to the second-year undergraduates inviting them to apply for the Concurrent Degree Program (CDP). More often than not, these postcards are met with confusion over what this program actually is. The department website gives a good introduction to what the program offers and this post aims to complement the website. Providing a more student-centric explanation/reflection about the program and the frequently asked questions (from juniors) that are not found on the website.</description>

      <description>The first post of the blog. I created this website with the intention of using it as a portfolio to link to various projects. But I got sucked into the deep rabbit hole of web designing and blogging that I decided to sacrifice one day to plow through numerous guides and documentation to create this spiffy site which can also blog.
Below are the key resources that I have consulted.</description>

      <description>About Me I have a general interest in using data and statistical methods to derive insights that can be acted upon and applied to the real-world. Domains which I feel invested in are Psychology, Psychometrics and Data Science/Analytics.
Education I studied Psychology at the National University of Singapore (NUS) under the Concurrent Degree Program. My thesis focused on the performance of different missing data techniques in joint ordinal-continuous measurement models.</description>
