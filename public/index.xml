      <description>The first post of the blog. I created this website with the intention of using it as a portfolio to link to various projects. But I got sucked into the deep rabbit hole of web designing and blogging that I decided to sacrifice one day to plow through numerous guides and documentation to create this spiffy site which can also blog.
Below are the key resources that I have consulted.</description>

      <description>About Me I have a general interest in using data and statistical methods to derive insights that can be acted upon and applied to the real-world. Domains which I feel invested in are Psychology, Psychometrics and Data Science/Analytics.
Education I studied Psychology at the National University of Singapore (NUS) under the Concurrent Degree Program. My thesis focused on the performance of different missing data techniques in joint ordinal-continuous measurement models.</description>
