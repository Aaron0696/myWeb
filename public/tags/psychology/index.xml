Year 5: Thesis Submission Time!Year 5 was the so-called final lap as a CDP student. Don’t be fooled into thinking that you have 2 years to complete your thesis, the thesis is due on the fourth week of your final semester so it was more like 1.5 years. At this point I was already reviewing my results and writing the manuscript. There were a few hiccups here and there, one particular panic point was when I found mistakes in some of my code, which resulted in me running some rather last-minute simulations.</description>

Year 4 Semester 2The second semester of the CDP was a research and statistics fiesta for me as I took two graduate level research modules and worked on my thesis.
PL5222 Multivariate Statistics In PsychologyPL5225 Structural Equation ModelingOverall, I greatly enjoyed this semester as the modules were all highly practical. The focus of these modules was to build sufficient understanding and confidence such that we could apply advanced statistical and research techniques to answer research questions.</description>

      <description>I embarked on an interesting project during the circuit-breaker period in Singapore where I used past bidding statistics from NUSMods to find the most popular Honors, Lab and Elective modules in NUS Psychology. For those who are currently in NUS or kept up with the news, you may have heard that the bidding system (CORS) was recently scrapped and replaced by a balloting system. Even though bidding is no longer used, I believe that the information of the popularity of modules is still relevant for balloting, which require students to rank their preferences.</description>

      <description>I just recently graduated after ending my last finals in May and will be starting work soon. I decided to take some time to reflect on my experience with the CDP program and share what it was like in CDP Psychology. The program had its ups and downs but overall I would say that it had slightly more ups.
Year 3 Semester 1/2: ApplicationI first heard about the program in my Y2S2 and found that I met most of the requirements for the program.</description>

      <description>Every year, the department of Psychology in NUS sends out little postcards to the second-year undergraduates inviting them to apply for the Concurrent Degree Program (CDP). More often than not, these postcards are met with confusion over what this program actually is. The department website gives a good introduction to what the program offers and this post aims to complement the website. Providing a more student-centric explanation/reflection about the program and the frequently asked questions (from juniors) that are not found on the website.</description>
