      <description>One of the greatest and worst things about using R is that there are so many different methods to tackle the same problem. Every time I become aware of an alternative method, I start to think thoughts such as “Is this better than my method?”, “Does this always give the same results as my current method?”.
Filtering is one scenario when these thoughts surface, there are multiple ways to filter data but what are the actual differences between them?</description>
