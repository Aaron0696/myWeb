<p>The first post of the blog. I created this website with the intention of using it as a portfolio to link to various projects. But I got sucked into the deep rabbit hole of web designing and blogging that I decided to sacrifice one day to plow through numerous guides and documentation to create this spiffy site which can also blog.</p>
<p>Below are the key resources that I have consulted.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the theme of this website: <a href="https://github.com/jakewies/hugo-theme-codex" class="uri">https://github.com/jakewies/hugo-theme-codex</a></li>
<li>Learning about <code>blogdown</code>: <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/</a></li>
</ul>
