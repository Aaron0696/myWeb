<p>One of the <em>greatest</em> and <em>worst</em> things about using R is that there are so many different methods to tackle the same problem. Every time I become aware of an alternative method, I start to think thoughts such as “Is this better than my method?”, “Does this always give the same results as my current method?”.</p>
<p>Filtering is one scenario when these thoughts surface, there are multiple ways to filter data but what are the actual differences between them? I wrote this post to formally pen down the differences and to resolve these doubts.</p>
<div id="filtering" class="section level1">
<h1>Filtering</h1>
<p>Filtering is the act of choosing a subset of your current data that fits some criteria. In R, this is the act of selecting/discarding certain rows from a dataframe. As far as I am aware, there are three popular methods to filter data.</p>
<p>To illustrate the differences between these three methods, lets create a small dataframe to illustrate their differences.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mydata &lt;- data.frame(x1 = 1:10,
                     x2 = c(1:4,NA,NA,7:10),
                     row.names = NULL)
mydata</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    x1 x2
## 1   1  1
## 2   2  2
## 3   3  3
## 4   4  4
## 5   5 NA
## 6   6 NA
## 7   7  7
## 8   8  8
## 9   9  9
## 10 10 10</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="subset-operator" class="section level1">
<h1>Subset Operator <code>[]</code></h1>
<p>The most basic way to filter would probably be using the subset operator <code>[]</code> in R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># give me the rows where x1 is more than 5
mydata[mydata$x1 &gt; 5,]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    x1 x2
## 6   6 NA
## 7   7  7
## 8   8  8
## 9   9  9
## 10 10 10</code></pre>
<p>Here is what happens when we use the subset operator to filter on a column with <code>NA</code> variables.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># give me the data where x2 is less than 3
mydata[mydata$x2 &lt; 3,]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      x1 x2
## 1     1  1
## 2     2  2
## NA   NA NA
## NA.1 NA NA</code></pre>
<p>Unexpected things happen with the subset operator. It seems like the <code>NA</code> values get caught in the filter and are returned even though <code>NA</code> is not less than 3. The reason for this behavior is because evaluating <code>NA</code> in any logical statement (except <code>is.na()</code>) will produce <code>NA</code> as an output.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>NA &gt; 3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] NA</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>NA == &quot;NA&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] NA</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>NA == NA</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] NA</code></pre>
<p>While this may be the quickest way to filter, it breaks down when there are missing values in the filtering variable.</p>
<p>To prevent this behavior, we need additional conditional statements. But this is a hassle to write and read.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># give me the data where x2 is less than 3
mydata[mydata$x2 &lt; 3 &amp; !is.na(mydata$x2),]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   x1 x2
## 1  1  1
## 2  2  2</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="subset" class="section level1">
<h1><code>subset()</code></h1>
<p>The <code>subset()</code> function is the second way to filter. It is part of base R so I prefer it over the tidyverse <code>filter()</code> as I tend to find myself in work where I may not have the luxury to install every package I need.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># give me the rows where x1 is more than 5
subset(mydata,
       mydata$x1 &gt; 5)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    x1 x2
## 6   6 NA
## 7   7  7
## 8   8  8
## 9   9  9
## 10 10 10</code></pre>
<p>Lets see how it handles the missing values in x2 when we filter on x2.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># give me the data where x2 is less than 3
subset(mydata,
       mydata$x2 &lt; 3)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   x1 x2
## 1  1  1
## 2  2  2</code></pre>
<p>This time it seems to work! <code>subset()</code> behaves as expected.</p>
</div>
<div id="filter-from-dplyr" class="section level1">
<h1><code>filter()</code> from <em>dplyr</em></h1>
<p>Up last is <code>filter()</code> from <code>dplyr</code>. I personally use this very infrequently because I picked up R sticking to base R. But I do use the other <code>tidyverse</code> functions quite frequently as some of them are indeed very powerful. I would use <code>filter()</code> when I find myself inside a pipe (<code>%&gt;%</code>) chain and I don’t wish to awkwardly exit the pipe to <code>subset()</code>, just to pipe the data in again.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;:
## 
##     filter, lag</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;:
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># give me the rows where x1 is more than 5
mydata %&gt;% filter(x1 &gt; 5)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   x1 x2
## 1  6 NA
## 2  7  7
## 3  8  8
## 4  9  9
## 5 10 10</code></pre>
<p>Lets see how it handles the missing values in x2 when we filter on x2.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># give me the data where x2 is less than 3
mydata %&gt;% filter(x2 &lt; 3)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   x1 x2
## 1  1  1
## 2  2  2</code></pre>
<p>It seems like filter works just as well!</p>
</div>
<div id="summary" class="section level1">
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Avoid using the subset operators <code>[]</code> to filter unless you are sure that the filtering variable has no missing values <code>NA</code>.<code>subset()</code> and dplyr’s <code>filter()</code> are preferred as they exclude missing values. Choosing between the two would be personal preference or depend on the context.</p>
