# About Me

I have a general interest in using data and statistical methods to derive insights that can be acted upon and applied to the real-world. Domains which I feel invested in are *Psychology*, *Psychometrics* and *Data Science/Analytics*.

## Education

I studied Psychology at the National University of Singapore (NUS) under the Concurrent Degree Program. My thesis focused on the performance of different missing data techniques in joint ordinal-continuous measurement models.
